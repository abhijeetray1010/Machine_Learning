## Machine Learning

          This repository is all about Applied Machine Learning.
          As multiple algorithms could be used to work on a particular dataset, all the jupyter notebooks 
          in this repository are sorted by integral prefixes before their names so that it is easy to find 
          the algorithm with respect to the data we are working on. This repository is an ocean of knowledge 
          for a person who is interested in Applied Machine Learning techniques. So Enjoy !
