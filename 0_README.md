## Machine Learning

          This repository is all about Machine Learning and its algorithms implemented efficiently.
          As multiple Algorithms could be used to work on a particular dataset, all the jupyter notebooks in this repository are sorted by
          integral prefixes before their names so that it is easy to find the algorithm with respect to the data we are working on. 
          This repository is an ocean of knowledge for a person who is interested in Applied Machine Learning techniques. So Enjoy !
